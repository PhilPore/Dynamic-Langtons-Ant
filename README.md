# Dynamic-Langtons-Ant
Langton's Ant. We have a traverser that moves around a grid that denotes how it moves, with the area it was on changing. It's intended to show chaotic motion and be something of a 2D turing machine. I'm intending on making it more dynamic by you being able to click more ants in on the graph. This is a HEAVY work in progress.
