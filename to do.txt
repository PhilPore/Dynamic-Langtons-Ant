Traverser:

- Orientation
- Unique step count variable (for collision)
- Left Right enums
- Two maps for row and col


Functions:
- updating unique steps variable
- Traverser collision, if activated
- Maybe overlap?

Grid:
- Dynamically make ants with ncurses. How will we account for them?
- Generating a grid that doesnt always need to refresh - > done by ncurses
- Keeping the traverser(s) in the grid (or maybe this needs to be in the function to do)
- Overlap if the collision flag is not active
- Representation for the ants
- 2d grid, likely going to use ascii similar to dwarfs fortress
??? what kind of wacky stuff do I want to add?
